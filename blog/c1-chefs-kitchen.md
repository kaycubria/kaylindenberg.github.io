Fireside Chat Reflection

Thoughts on Culture

These are reflections on the Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table available here http://vimeo.com/85001014

Honestly, I really loved the ideas presented here. I truly appreciate the idea of "being set on track to be a world class beginner!"

I tend to approach new things with a can-do attitude. I’m going to try my best and do my best work and not leave anything on the table. That attitude has served me well throughout my life, and I hope it serves me well in the Dev Bootcamp experience too. 

The video definitely reinforces the idea that Dev Bootcamp isn’t going to be easy. But it’s going to teach me what I need to know to have a solid foundation in development that can be built upon over a lifetime. It also reinforced that Dev Bootcamp itself is still growing and changing that that my experience will be different from prior cohorts or future cohorts. 

Of course, there are a few things about the Dev Bootcamp experience that make me a little nervous. Mainly, I’m worried about the intensity of the in-person experience. I do tend to give things my all, but that said, I feel like it’s going to be important to put up boundaries. Several past Dev Bootcampers mentioned how they were overwhelmed and hit a wall during the in-person phase because they weren’t sleeping or seeing their family. I know I’m a better learner when I’m happy and well rested, so I want to be sure I don’t let my life become unbalanced while I’m in training.

Overall, I’m very excited to meet my cohort-mates in person and get going. This first week has been great and I really enjoy being in a learning environment again. I’m looking forward to week two and more learning!
