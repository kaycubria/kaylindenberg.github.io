  <h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>Values That Are Important to Me</h2>
  <h4>Friday, January 16, 2015</h4>

      When I think of the moments in life where I’ve been the happiest, proudest and most satisfied, they usually come when I have accomplishment something challenging (often something others said I couldn’t do). I like to share these moments with family and, if possible, leverage them to help others. I try to live up to these values – accomplishment, family and helping others – at all times.

      For me, accomplishing things is extremely important in life because it allows you to define yourself and set yourself apart from others. Family is so important to me because I’ve learned the hard way that family is sometimes all you have. I believe in helping others because I try to follow the Golden Rule.

      The last time someone asked my advice on something, they wanted help understanding their own complicated family situation and what sort of action they should take toward a family member. While this didn’t play into my sense of accomplishment, it did touch on my strong value for my family as well as my interest in helping others and treating everyone with compassion and understanding.

      I do think my values can help me mediate stereotype threat. Frist off, my value of accomplishment, and my like for accomplishing things that people think I can’t do, will hopefully help me get past any sort of behavior that implies that I can’t or won’t succeed at DBC. Second, my values for family and helping others are things about myself that I am confident in and help define what I think of when I think of myself. Being secure about who I am will hopefully help stop others from projecting negative images on me (or at least stop those images from having any impact on me).

      Other exercises I like to use when I’m down include: exercise, talking to close family and friends, volunteering and taking some “me” time to be on my own with my thoughts.
