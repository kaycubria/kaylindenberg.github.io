  <h1>Thinking and Learning Styles</h1>
  <h2>Reflections on Three Weeks of Learning in DevBootcamp</h2>
  <h4>Saturday, December 6, 2014</h4>

    	As part of the prep to start DevBootcamp, I took a survey to find out more about my learning style. The survey suggests which of the four Gregorc Thinking Styles you are most comfortable. The results came as absolutely no surprise to me. My scores as an “abstract sequential” and “concrete sequential” thinker tied at around 40 each, while scores for “concrete random” and “abstract random” also tied at about 20 each. Since high scores indicate your preference, what I gather from the survey is that I am sequential, but comfortable with both concrete and abstract concepts.

    	Having taken my share (or perhaps more than my share) of these sorts of learning and personality surveys, these results seem in line with how I typically test. I am well aware that I am fairly linear and quite analytical. I like to review and analyze facts in order to develop hypotheses to test before eventually reaching a conclusion and acting on the data. I like learning and thinking about concrete and abstract topics.

    	I’ve found out work in DevBootcamp to be a nice mix of concrete and abstract learning, so it has been a fun challenge so far! We’ve generally progressed in a linear fashion, so I’ve been happy with our curriculum as well. Thus far, in fact, the thing that I’ve struggled with most has been time-related. I’m a thorough person who likes to be able to spend the time I need on new material to feel comfortable with it – I don’t like to do things half-way. Without any time off last week for Thanksgiving, and a huge quantity of material to cover, I didn’t feel like I got to spend as much time with the materials as I would have liked to. This week, however, was much better and I’m hoping to have some extra time to review last week’s materials during our holiday break in a couple of weeks.

    	I hope I can continue to grow and learn in DevBootcamp! One thing I anticipate struggling with is when I start to deal with more people in the program, some of whom will not be as sequential as I am. I know this can be a challenge for me, but I hope that we can still pair together and learn from each other through effective communication.
