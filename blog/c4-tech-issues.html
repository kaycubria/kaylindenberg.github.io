  <h1>Anonymity, Privacy and Identity in the Digital Age</h1>
  <h2>Reflections on an Issue Facing the Tech Industry</h2>
  <h4>Friday, December 12, 2014</h4>

    	The experience of having an ad pop up in your Facebook news feed for a product you just viewed on Amazon, or similarly discovering that an item mentioned in a recent email is now being advertised when you log in to Gmail can be a bit disconcerting. Browsing the Internet from the comfort of your home can seem to be a very anonymous experience, but at illusion of anonymity is shattered by targeted advertising, which is perhaps the most overt demonstration of the massive digital footprint typical Internet users leave.

    	The technology industry faces a number of interesting dilemmas related to user data. Perhaps the most fundamental question is that of whose data. Courts in the United States and European answer this question very differently. In general, European courts say that data belongs to the user that created it and may only be used by other parties after notification and consent by the users while in the U.S., data belongs to the collector, as long as it is legally obtained (this oversimplifies things slightly, but much more detailed discussions of these issues are readily available online, <<a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2007/09/privacy-concepts-us-v-eu">here</a>, for example). 
    </p>
    <p>
    	A related issue is what data is collected and how that data is used. While this might seem like a problem only of concern for the privacy rights crew, it is actually an issue for data collectors too. Cookies and other tracking software make it possible to collect almost infinite quantities of data, but at some point, the costs of collecting and attempting to analyze everything that can be collected far exceeds any potential advantage to such big data collection programs.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The final issue for this post – which only begins to touch on the myriad related issues – relates to the right to be anonymous (if such a right exists) online. Users being tracked and cookied at every turn are clearly not anonymous, but should they be able to be? Should someone be able to go online and anonymously alert the police to an illegal plot? What happens if the tables are turned and the anonymous party is issuing a threat or bullying a school peer? 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Issues of anonymity, privacy and user identity in the digital age are complex and there is no one right answer nor no easy solution. While I am perhaps more comfortable with the European model of digital data ownership, this is not to say that it is the solution the United States should adopt. I do, however, think that these issues deserve a robust public debate and, eventually legislative action, as existing law from even a decade or two ago – which courts must interoperate and issue rulings based on – does not seem to have kept pace with the immense technological shift that has taken place in the same period of time.
