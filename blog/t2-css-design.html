  <h2>Margins, Boarders and Padding: The CSS "Box Model"</h2>
  <h4>Friday, November 29, 2014</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      When working with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), margins, boarders and padding form boxes around text, tables, images and other HTML elements. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Padding is transparent space surrounding the HTML element, separating the element from the boarder. Padding puts space between the element and a boarder - this means that if your text is surrounded by a boarder, the text doesn't directly hit the boarder, but instead is easy to read because letters are far enough away from the boarder to be ledgable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Boarders surround the padding and may be visible (ie not transparent). A boarder is what you think of from craft class when you're small: a boxlike thing that goes around something else, in this case, the padding with the content inside it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Margins surround the boarders which, in turn contain the padding and the content. Margins are also transparent and spararate elements with padding and boarders from each other.

        The following chart from W3School nicely illustrates margins, boarders, padding and content:
