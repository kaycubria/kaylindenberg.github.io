  <h1>Working in Pairs</h1>
  <h2>Reflections on Feedback</h2>
  <h4>Saturday, December 20, 2014</h4>

      In DevBootcamp Phase 0, we regulary pair to solve challenges. In fact, each week we are required to work on one challenge with a partner and to pair at least twice. Most weeks also feature a “GPS” or guided pairing session, meaning that three plus pairing sessions is the norm most weeks.

      <p>
        In general, I have found pairing to be enjoyable. It has been interesting to see how others approach problems and to compare approaches. Some of my pairs have been more technically knowledgeable, having had prior coding experience, and have been able to share some tips and tricks that have been very helpful when I’ve been trying to test and improve my code.
      </p>

      <p>
        After each pairing session, we are required to submit feedback about working in our pair. I was happy to see that, for the most part, most of my pairs had positive things to say about our sessions since I generally feel like most of my session have gone well and I have largely submitted positive feedback as well!

        I did have one very challenging pairing session where I felt like my pair did not want give me time to participate/contribute to our project. It was hard to write feedback in this case because I tend to be someone who follows the rule of not saying anything if you don’t have something nice to say. DevBootcamp emphasizes providing constructive – actionable, specific and kind – is challenging because it’s easy to provide feedback that is not actionable and specific, but instead is simply encouraging (that was a great session, keep up the good work!).

      <p>
        From reading my feedback, I feel like I need to continue to work to improve my technical skills and build on my development vocabulary so I can better express what I am doing during pairing sessions. Overall, I was really happy to read that most of my pairs had found the experience of working with me to be good and I hope to keep that positive record going!
