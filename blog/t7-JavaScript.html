  <h1>Ruby and JavaScript</h1>
  <h2>So Similar, But Still So Different</h2>

      After working with Ruby for the past few weeks – and having previously learned some basic Ruby in order to get into DevBootcamp – the idea of transition to a new language was intimidating. Ruby and JavaScript, however, are so alike that, for the most part, the “transition” actually felt more like a review of basic Ruby principals.

      For someone familiar with Ruby, familiar object types abound in JavaScript. Numbers, strings, Booleans, arrays… check, check, check, check!! One thing you will miss the hash, a data structure that, in Ruby, allows users to store key-value pairs. Have no fear though, JavaScript gets around this by allowing objects to have characteristics that have values. The two structures look and function similarly.

    Ruby
  </p>

  <pre class="CodeSample">
baby = {
name => “Veronica”,
height=> 18,
weight=>6.5}
</pre>

<p>
JavaScript
</p>

<pre class="CodeSample">
var baby = { 
name: “Veronica”,
height: 18
weight: 6.5};
</pre>

    <p>
      In fact, if we use symbols as our hash keys in Ruby, the two structures look almost identical:
    </p>

    <pre class="CodeSample">
baby = { 
name: “Veronica”,
height: 18
weight: 6.5}
</pre>

      <p>
      Ruby and JavaScript also have methods and functions including the ability to iterate (loop). You can easily build conditional logic into your code so that a function does one thing if a condition is met and another if it is not. There are some differences in how this all works, but in general, big picture, the concepts are the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      The big difference between Ruby and JavaScript seems to be in the syntax. Ruby provides a lot of “syntactic sugar" that make things easier to read and type. JavaScript is a bit more rigid. For example, calling a function in Ruby can be done by simply typing the function name if it doesn’t take any arguments:
    </p>

    <pre class="CodeSample">
function
    </pre>

    <p>
      In JavaScript you need to specify indicate the parameters, even if the function doesn’t take any:
    </p>

    <pre class="CodeSample">
function()
    </pre>

    <p>
      Another interesting differences is that JavaScript needs to be told to return something or it will return “undefined.” Ruby, on the other hand, will automatically return the last bit of code it executed.
