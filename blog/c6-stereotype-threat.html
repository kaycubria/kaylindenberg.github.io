  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>And How it Affects Me</h2>
  <h4>Wednesday, January 7, 2015</h4>

      The question one’s identity is an interesting one. Who are you?
    </p>

    <p>
      How do you answer who you are? What or who defines you? Do you define yourself by what you are or by what you are not? By who you know, where you live, how you look or what you wear?
    </p>

    <p>
      And, regardless of how you define yourself, how do others see you? What categories of person do you fall into just by your looks and being? How do you let those automatic characterizations affect how you act?
    </p>

    <p>
      I think everyone has experienced being “categorized” or stereotyped based on uncontrollable characteristics. For me, a fairly petite, young, white female, I find that people will sometimes try to behave better than they might otherwise – by apologizing when they curse or trying to hold the door, etc. Of course, implicit and sometime explicitly tied to this sort of behavior is often an assumption of naivety. The number of times I’ve been told to go check with my dad or tell my husband something would be fairly comical, if it were not also being said in a completely serious manner.
    </p>

      Perhaps no stereotype bugs me more than the assumption that I do not (and cannot) understand something. Again, perhaps it’s my age or my looks, but I tend to get this a lot and nothing, NOTHING, motivates me more than when this happens. To the professor who said that girls like me can’t be econ majors (or more precisely that there are “other ways” for girls like me get econ majors): thank you very much. I got my major exactly the same way all the other guys and girls got theirs, with a lot of studying and hard work.

      It can be hard when you are categorized (and especially when you are mis-categorized). I can see how it can lead to underachievement as people allow themselves to fall into the roles that people defined for them. For me, though, the best ways to fight against this sort of undesirable outcome is to use the characterization as a challenge and work to surprise your stereotyper.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another note worth making is that, having experienced stereotyping that I did not appreciate, I do my best to try not to judge anyone in advance, but instead let people show and tell me who they are. It’s a challenge, but remaining open minded and trying to see what is best in people is also one of the most powerful ways to demonstrate that you respect your fellow beings.
