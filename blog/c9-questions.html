  <h1>Good Questions</h1>
  <h2>Asking the Right Questions to Get Helpful Answers</h2>

      I’ll be the first to admit that I’m a little shy, so asking questions on a public forum – or blogging, for that matter – is not my first choice of possible actions. I would much prefer to send a detailed question to a few trusted friends or knowledgeable acquaintances than blast my question to “infinity and beyond” on an online forum. None the less, in many ways, a good question is a good question is a good question, whether you’re asking a select group from your network or your entire network (plus some) online.

      To start out, in our digital word, the subject line of your question is critical. Especially if you are sending your question off to the masses think long and hard about your subject, since it is likely going to determine whether someone is intrigued and keeps reading to learn more or if they will ignore your plea for help entirely. Especially with programming questions, this means you want to be sure your subject covers the basics: what system/program/language and the problem. For example, a subject “looping problem” isn’t likely to get you nearly the response as “Ruby unless loop construction error” because looping is so common, many Ruby experts will overlook your first query assuming you are referring to another language.

      There’s a lot of good advice out there for writing the body of your questions, but my advice is to keep it simple. State your problem. Just your problem. As clearly and concisely as you can. In plain English, with the problematic code snippet. A brief, pseudocode-like explanation of what you are trying to do (inputs and desired outputs) will usually suffice. Again, be sure to clarify basic information like the language that you are trying to use. For example you might write “Trying to determine dress size using Ruby dress_size method with measures as arguments. Code seems to double everyone’s size. Please help. Code below:” Now tell me if you don’t think you’ll get some clever answers to that one…
