  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h2>Analyzing a Past Conflict and My Responses to It</h2>
  <h4>Friday, January 23, 2015</h4>

      I am extremely conflict adverse. 
    </p>

    <p>
      My typical response to a potential conflict is to avoid it. This is usually practiced by letting the other party do whatever they want to and then dealing with the consequences. I am also a big believer in allowing people to be autonomous individuals, so I think stepping back and letting people do what they want to comes fairly naturally.

      Unfortunately there are times when conflict is unavoidable.
    </p>

    <p>
      An old colleague of mine who was extremely conflict-oriented used to like to ask my opinion just so she could contradict what I said. Typically, I would just ignore her provocation by saying something along the lines of “that’s an interesting way to look at things” or “I hadn’t thought of it that way before.” I did feel annoyed, but I also respected that I was in a workplace and needed to be able to continue to work with my colleague, even if we didn’t agree on everything (or anything, apparently).
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that I no longer work with that colleague, I sometimes think I should have spoken up and let her know that I didn’t appreciate being constantly contradicted and criticized. I think doing so in a polite manner would have at least allowed me to feel like I had tried to stand up for myself and improve an unpleasant situation. I’m not sure it would have fixed anything, but it probably couldn’t have made things worse.
