  <h1>The Internet</h1>
  <h2>What it is and how it Works</h2>

      In a few short decades, the Internet has gone from being a novelty to being integral to our daily lives. From doing research for a work project, to checking what events friends are going to on a social media and to ordering dinner, you can do almost anything online these days! 
    </p>

    <p>
      But what exactly is the Internet?
    </p>

    <p>
      Put simply: the Internet is a global computer network.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices connect to each other and to servers storing large quantities of information through transmission lines – sometimes physical, but sometimes wireless – and nodes that route traffic.
    </p>

    <p>
      All this hardware can connect because it follows the same set of protocols for how to work together and transmit data. Because the hardware components of the Internet follow the same protocols, when you try to do something online, the other hardware knows how to respond and information can flow freely between your machine and the world.
