  <h2>Explanation of the Enumerable group_by Method</h2>

      Sometimes, situations arise when you need to create groups out of a collection of objects. This can be accomplished by using several Ruby methods, but one especially helpful method is group_by. The group_by method sends a message to the collection object it is acting upon and tells the object to group itself into a hash following parameters specified in the code block following the group_by method. If no code block is supplied, an enumerator is returned.

    <pre class="CodeSample">
print (1..15).group_by
#=>#<Enumerator:0x0000000276ae60>
print (1..15).group_by {|i| i%3}
#=>{1=>[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], 2=>[2, 5, 8, 11, 14], 0=>[3, 6, 9, 12, 15]}
    </pre>
    <p>
      There are a number of scenarios where group_by could be useful. One that comes to mind is in creating groups. For example, if a teacher has a class of 30 and wants to create small groups for studying, using a numbered attendance roster and the group_by method, the teacher could easily generate small groups and try out different sized groups with the class. Essentially, if the objects in a collection can be numbered, group_by allows them to easily be divided into sub-collections and accessed using any method available to the new hash they are put into.
