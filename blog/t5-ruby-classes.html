  <h1>Classes in Ruby</h1>
  <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
  <h4>Saturday, December 20, 2014</h4>

      In Ruby, it is possible to create an object and define as many methods for that object as you want. Easy! But what if you want more than one object to have access to those same methods. Easy again! Just create your new object and copy and paste to define all the same methods for your new object too. But what if you want 100 similar objects? Well that starts to get a little less easy… do you really want to copy and paste all that information 100 times over? And what happens if you want 1,000 or 10,000 or 1,000,000 similar objects? 
    </p>

    <p>
      Enter Ruby Classes. Classes – which, like virtually everything in Ruby, are themselves objects – allow you to create multiple objects that all begin their existence with the same basic characteristics and methods.

      Imagine you are writing a program for a restaurant because you want to be able to keep track of some business statistics for planning purposes. Every time a new party came in, you could create an entirely new object from scratch that tracks how big the party size is, what was ordered, etc. or you could create a class that already knew to look for that information and just create new instances of that class each time a new party came in like follows:
    </p>

    <pre class="CodeSample">
      class Party
  attr_accessor :party_size :food :beverage :bill
  def initialize(party_size)
    @party_size = party_size
    @food = food()
    @beverage = beverage()
    @bill = bill
  end
  def food_order(x*)
    @food << x
  end
  def beverage_order(x*)
    @beverage << x
  end
  def charges(x)
    @bill = “$” + x
  end
  def party_info
print “Party of #{@party_size} ordered #{@food} food items and #{@beverage} 
beverages and spent #{@bill}.”
  end
end
    </pre>
    
    <p>
      Now, a restuaranteur can simply create new instances of the class Party each time a new party comes in and keep track of everything that’s happening in the restaurant!
    </p>

    <pre class="CodeSample">
party1 = Party.new(2)
party1.food_order(large veggie pizza, large house salad)
party1.beverage_order(soda water, diet Coke)
party1.charges(25.75)
praty1.party_info

=>“Party of 2 ordered [“large veggie pizza”, “large house salad”] food items 
and [“soda water”, “diet Coke”] beverages and spent $25.75.”

party2 = Party.new(10)
…
    </pre>
