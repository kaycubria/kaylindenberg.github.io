  <h1>Classes and Modules in Ruby</h1>
  <h2>Similarities and Differences</h2>
  <h4>Wednesday, January 7, 2015</h4>

      Classes and modules are both (surprise!) objects in Ruby. In this fundamental way – and in many others – they are very similar, however, important differences do exist. Thinking about things as if you are an object: you are in a class (or, more technically, you are an instance of a class), but you may have knowledge of many modules that have been covered in (mixed-in) your class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Classes and modules are both Ruby constructs that help you organize your code and ensure that your objects can do what you want them to. Classes empower you to create multiple instances of objects that behave in the same ways while modules allow you to endow multiple types of objects with the same abilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, a Ticket class might include a price_lookup method that would allow us to determine the price of any individual ticket object. Alternatively a Price module might define a very similar lookup_price method we could then mix our Price module into our Ticket class, and another Grocery class and we could then query individual ticket and grocery instances to lookup_price. Since price_lookup was only defined in the Ticket class, asking a grocery to price_lookup would result in an error.
    </p>

    <p>
      So modules are collections of methods we want to be able to reuse across multiple classes while classes are collections of methods and modules that we want to be able to create instances of.
    </p>

    <p>
      To add just a bit of complication, it is worth noting that there exist sub- and super-classes which can also mix in modules and include their own methods. Instances of sub-classes inherit the functionality contained in their super-class(es), though that inheritance may be overwritten.
