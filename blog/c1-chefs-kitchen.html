      These are reflections on the Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table available <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">here</a>.

      Honestly, I really loved the ideas presented here. I truly appreciate the idea of "being set on track to be a world class beginner!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I tend to approach new things with a can-do attitude. I’m going to try my best and do my best work and not leave anything on the table. That attitude has served me well throughout my life, and I hope it serves me well in the Dev Bootcamp experience too. 
    </p>

      The video definitely reinforces the idea that Dev Bootcamp isn’t going to be easy. But it’s going to teach me what I need to know to have a solid foundation in development that can be built upon over a lifetime. It also reinforced that Dev Bootcamp itself is still growing and changing that that my experience will be different from prior cohorts or future cohorts.

      Of course, there are a few things about the Dev Bootcamp experience that make me a little nervous. Mainly, I’m worried about the intensity of the in-person experience. I do tend to give things my all, but that said, I feel like it’s going to be important to put up boundaries. Several past Dev Bootcampers mentioned how they were overwhelmed and hit a wall during the in-person phase because they weren’t sleeping or seeing their family. I know I’m a better learner when I’m happy and well rested, so I want to be sure I don’t let my life become unbalanced while I’m in training.

      Overall, I’m very excited to meet my cohort-mates in person and get going. This first week has been great and I really enjoy being in a learning environment again. I’m looking forward to week two and more learning!
